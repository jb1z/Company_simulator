# ***The program's description*** (the programm need rework, because the main idea was changed)
## **Extractive&Manufacturing  industry**
### Mettallurgy
* #### *Ferrous metallurgy*
    The mining of ferrous metal ores and the  beneficiation of these ores.
    The main mining elements are ***iron ore***, ***manganese ore*** and ***chrome ore***. These ores are used for creating ***cast iron***, ***steel***.  
    The cast iron is used for ***household needs*** and ***architecture of the house and adjacent territory***.  
    The steel is used for ***construction*** and ***instruments***.
* #### *Non-ferrous metallurgy*
    The mining of non-ferrous metal ores and the  beneficiation of these ores. There are heavy (copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel) and light (aluminum, titanium, magnesium) metals. This metallurgy would produce ***alloys*** of ***heavy*** and ***light*** mettals.
    The non-ferrous metalls are widely used for ***automotive industry*** and ***air industry***.
### Extraction of raw materials for energy production
